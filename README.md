# Vimium RC
This is my config for [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), it includes the default configs in a
Markdown format for reference and the actual configurations. The file is only meant to be a
copy-paste-able text to the `Custom key mappings` section of Vimium. Maybe in the future I will also
include the backup `.json` file that Vimium allows you to export. But for now, this is all I need
when changing setups or re-installing browsers.
